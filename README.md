Details of the Demos:
In demo1, we use Langchain to build an translation app and host it locally.
In demo2, we use Langchain to keep record of the chat history and conduct a conversation accordingly.
In demo3, we use Langchain to regulate the answers from AI in the given documents with the retrieving feature.
In demo4, we use Tavily and LangChain to search online to mitigate the knowledge gap of AI.
In demo5, we use LangChain to build RAG to include specific online resources in the AI knowledge base.
In demo6. We use LangChain to include database information in the answer, by using a chain or by using an agent.
In demo7, we save the content in a vector and load content from the vector. We also search information in the content based on similarity with additional conditions (e.g. publish year).
In demo8, we learnt how to build structured data with Pydantic which is an important library for OOP, then we use LangChain and Pydantic to extract structured data from natural language.
In demo9, we use LangChain to generate random text or structured data based on instructions and examples.
In demo10, we use LangChain to classify text in specified categories.
In demo11-1, we use Stuff method to summarize an article.
In demo11-2, we use Map-Reduce method to summarize a long novel.
In demo11-3, we use Refine method to summarize an article, and it is quite slow.
